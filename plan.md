# January Linear Algebra Review

To get the most out of Gov 2002, it will be very useful to have a working understanding of the basics of linear algebra. For Gov PhD students, you covered some of this in the Math Prefresher, but probably not enough to keep it fresh in your mind. This year, we are organizing an optional, self-guided review of the basics of linear algebra. It will take place (virtually of course) in the three weeks before the start of the Spring semester (January 4th-January 22nd). The content will be based on MIT's famous 18.06 course, and we will follow along with the textbook and videos for this class.

As the weeks approach, we will post a set of exercised to complete for each of the weeks from the Strang book. Solutions to those exercises will be available. We will also hold office hours in each of the weeks to answer questions or go over solutions to the 


## Week 1 (January 4th)

- Topics: Vectors, Matrices, Solving Linear Equation, Inverses, Transposes
- Reading: Strang Ch. 1-2
- Videos: 18.06 Videos 1-5

## Week 2 (January 11th)

- Topics: Vector spaces, rank, independence, basis
- Reading: Strang Ch. 3 
- Videos: 18.06 Videos 6-10 
- NB: In Section 3.2 you can skim the mechanics of echeleon forms. the defintion of nullspaces and rank are what are important. Skim Section 3.3 for our purposes; most important to understand the summary on p. 155.

## Week 3 (January 18th)

- Topics: Orthognality, projection
- Reading: Strang Ch. 4
- Videos: 18.06 14-17
